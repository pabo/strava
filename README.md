# Strava
This is a lightweight strava client as a playground for learning tech like `react-query`, `vite`, and others.

The back end is `vite-express`. It handles user auth and proxies requests to the strava API with the auth token.

The front end is `react`, `react-query`.

# TODOS
- more network erorr handling

# Bugs
- login auth refresh loop
